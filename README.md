# Sudoku Application

ðŸ’« This project started as a brute-force Sudoku solver, and from there expanded into a fully playable application.

---

## Features

ðŸ’™ The Solver: Optimising the original brute-force method, this program first uses a few Sudoku solving techniques (including finding boxes that can only contain 1 possible number) to reduce the time it takes to solve the Sudoku. 

ðŸ’™ The Generator: This program can randomly generate Sudoku grids which have one exact solution. It starts by randomly creating a complete grid, and then repeatedly removes numbers to increase the difficulty, while checking for each removed number that it maintains the unique solution.

ðŸ’™ Users also have the option from the start menu to input their own Sudoku grid they may be stuck on to be solved by the program.
